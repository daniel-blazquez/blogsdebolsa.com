# blogsdebolsa.com
A basic RSS aggregator to consolidate indie blogs focused on the IBEX stock index

# app core
blogsdebolsa.com is built on top of the Lylina project. Lylina is a PHP web app that aggregates the content of a collection of RSS feeds. It can be described as a PHP module that replicates the functionality of an RSS reade. Only the site admin can modify the selection of RSS sources.

Lylina is in turn built on top of another project, Lilina. Lyline adds MySQL support to Lilina. Lilina leverages Magpie to retreive and process RSS and Atom feeds.

# Lylina modifications
-Generation of RSS feed
-CSS style modifications
-Some fields added to the source profile (source site URL)
